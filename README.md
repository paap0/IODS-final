# IODS_final
Final assignment for the course IODS Autumn 2017 University of Helsinki

This repository contains all that I have prepared for the final assignment. I chose to take a closer look at the datasets about Portuquese students (zip: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00320/ and metadata: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance). I aimed to describe current social, demographic and performance factors as well as to investigate associations between multiple categorical variables and alcohol consumption. Due to my enthusiasm it was impossible to provide a condense report within the tight time limits. There are so many cool ways to visualize MCAs and to improve the appearance of Rmarkdown-files.

My repository is here https://github.com/paap0/IODS-final and the wrap-up of my work can be found http://paap0.github.io/IODS-final

THANKS EVERYONE!
